# Delete orders for Magento2

Standard installation of Magento2 does not allow you to delete orders in admin panel. But for testing you need to place some orders to check that everything is working correctly. This small extension allows deleting orders using Magento's mass action. Hence, no more SQL hacking required to cleanup your test orders.
